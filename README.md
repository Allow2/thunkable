Instructions on using Allow2 to add Parental Freedom to your Thunkable app. https://thunkable.com

These instructions are also available as a public (remixable) example app here: https://x.thunkable.com/projects/60a50360a2ce930011586261

## Step 1: Pairing

As with all Allow2 implementations, the app user (or parent) needs to opt-in to Parental Freedom by "pairing" the app with the platform.

To do this, you need to give an option, perhaps in settings for "Parental Freedom", which will allow the parent to open a pairing setup dialog or screen.
